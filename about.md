I am an analyst at [Tier](https://www.tier.app/). I help finance and management teams to make better decisions, using all the information we are collecting from our business operations. Before that, I completed my master's degree in Project Management & Data Science and worked as a marketing analyst during my studies at [Casper](https://www.casper.com/). I grew up in Turkey and studied Industrial Engineering at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/).
