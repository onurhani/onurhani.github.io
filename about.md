I am a data analyst at [Tier](https://www.tier.app/). I help our team to automate processes and make better decisions using data. Before that, I completed my master's degree in Project Management & Data Science and worked as a marketing analyst during my studies at [Casper](https://www.casper.com/). I grew up in Turkey and studied industrial engineering at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/). 

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/onur_irkin) or send me an [e-mail](mailto:onurhan.irkin@gmail.com) to say hi.
